This project is a simple word-guessing game implemented in Python. It is encapsulated within a class named Secound_Project, which includes methods for displaying game rules, handling the guessing process, converting lists to strings, and checking the final result. The game begins by showing the rules to the player. The Gamming_Function prompts the user to fill in the missing characters of a word. The Convert_List method concatenates the characters into a complete word. Finally, the Check_Result method compares the user's guessed word to the correct word to determine if they win or lose. The sample word for guessing is "hello" with missing characters represented by underscores, which the user needs to fill correctly.
